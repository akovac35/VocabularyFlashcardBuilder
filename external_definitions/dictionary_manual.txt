{{"apeiron","noun"} -> "The unlimited, indeterminate, and indefinite ground, origin, or primal principle of all matter. Postulated especially by Anaximander."}
{{"a priori"} -> "To know something a priori is to know it from pure logic, without having to gather any evidence. For example, you can know that triangles have three sides without having to examine any actual triangles and count their sides."}
{{"cinvariance","noun"} -> "Symmetry of physical laws under a charge-conjugation transformation. Also c-symmetry."}
{{"cogito","verb"} -> "Cogito ergo sum. The principle of establishing the existence of a being from the fact of its thinking or awareness."}
{{"coinversion","noun"} -> "The inversion operation of a cogroup (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cogroup) object. A coinversion must satisfy the dual versions of the axioms for group objects. The simultaneous inversion of multiple related objects."}
{{"copernican","adjective"} -> "Following the theory of Nicolaus Copernicus: sun, rather than earth, is the center of the universe."}
{{"syndiffeonesis","noun"} -> "The expression and/or existence of any difference relation entails a common medium and syntax. For example, an apple and a pear have physical property shape; the shape is not the same for the two objects. Reality is a relation, and every relation is a syndiffeonic relation exhibiting syndiffeonesis or 'difference-in-sameness'. Therefore, reality is a syndiffeonic relation. Syndiffeonesis implies that any assertion to the effect that two things are different implies that they are reductively the same; if their difference is real, then they both reduce to a common reality and are to that extent similar. Syndiffeonesis, the most general of all reductive principles, forms the basis of a new view of the relational structure of reality."}
{{"occam's razor","unknown"} -> "Occam's razor (or Ockham's razor) is a principle from philosophy. Suppose there exist two explanations for an occurrence. In this case the one that requires the least speculation is usually correct. Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation."}
{{"nihilo","noun"} -> "Nothing."}
{{"momenergy","noun"} -> "Combining momentum and energy into a single quantity, momenergy."}
{{"diffeonesis","noun"} -> "Existence of difference. A differentiative function of arity or cardinality."}
{{"hological","adjective"} -> "Having the property that overall structure is distributed on all scales, implying similarity to an observed scale on all scales - i.e. self similarity."}
{{"hology","noun"} -> "Hology is a logical analogue of holography characterizing the most general relationship between reality and its contents. It is a form of self-similarity whereby the overall structure of the universe is everywhere distributed within it as accepting and transductive syntax, resulting in a homogeneous syntactic medium. This means that analysing any one object, the most general features of reality as a whole must be present in it. Hology is justified by the fact that the universe has nothing other than its own syntactic 'coding' to double up as its own 'state'/objects.For example, suppose you hit a tennis ball with a racket. In the conventional picture, its fate-whether it will hit the net, or bounce into a wall, or fly out of the court—depends on the state of reality outside of you: the positions of surrounding objects, the wind speed, etc. But according to hology, all of this information is already present in your 'syntax', or set of laws that governs you. In this new picture, what you see happen to the tennis ball is determined by your own internal processing, and all of the objects which you see as 'outside' of you are actually being simulated by your syntax. Hology says that every part of reality has the structure needed to internally simulate its external environment in this way, turning the conventional picture 'outside-in': This results in a “distributed subjectivization” in which everything occurs inside the objects; the objects are simply defined to consistently internalize their interactions, effectively putting every object “inside” every other one in a generalized way and thereby placing the contents of space on the same footing as that formerly occupied by the containing space itself. Vectors and tensors then become descriptors of the internal syntactic properties and states of objects. In effect, the universe becomes a 'self-simulation' running inside its own contents. For more on the 'dual' relationship between this picture and the conventional one, see conspansive duality."}
{{"ectomorphism","noun"} -> "In an ectomorphism, something is mapped to, generated or replicated in something external to it. Not to be confused with ectomorphic in biology."}
{{"endomorphism","noun"} -> "In an endomorphism, something is mapped to, generated or replicated in something internal to it."}
{{"ectosyntactic","adjective"} -> "Ectosyntactic syntax is the syntax governing the distribution of and relationships between syntactic operators. In other words, the syntax of space."}
{{"infocognition","noun"} -> "Information and cognition (i.e. action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses). Infocognition is to combine information and cognition into a single quantity."}
{{"infocognitive","adjective"} -> "Able to process information gathered with cognition (action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses)."}
{{"qualioperceptual","adjective"} -> "Having the ability to interpret or become aware of something through the senses as individual experiences."}
{{"conspansion","noun"} -> "In the CTMU, conspansion is the alternating process by which reality evolves. Conspansion is so called because it involves material CONtraction during space exPANSION. Material contraction is what the objects in the universe are undergoing from a global vantage (each future state is being injected into the previous state and everything is shrinking within its own boundaries along with the measurement metric for space time). Spatial expansion is what the universe looks like it is undergoing as a function of time from a local vantage. The "dual" relationship between these two vantages is called conspansive duality."}
{{"synetic","adjective"} -> "Having the property of synesis."}
{{"syntactor","noun"} -> "A syntactor, portmanteau of syntactic operator, is self-transducing information -- the fundamental entity in SCSPL -- a coherent processor capable of or responsive to telic recursion -- an entity in the universe which is able to process information by virtue of being able to read-write SCSPL syntax. Purpose-driven syntactors are telors, e.g. God and humans. The most fundamental syntactor is a noeon. The universe is made out of one essential substance (infocognition) having two aspects; information and cognition. It could not be made of information alone as without a syntax to process that information, it means nothing."}
{{"noeon","noun"} -> "A noeon is a quantum of infocognition -- a tiny microscopic quantum syntactor that forms the unit of perception. Since the CTMU is an infocognitive monism, a noeon is a fundamental construct."}
{{"telor","noun"} -> "A telor is a syntactor creating a telon. Telors can be high up or low down in the universal hierarchy of agents (where reality as a whole is the ultimate Agent, God, and human beings are higher up than rocks but less than God)."}
{{"telon","noun"} -> "A telon or telic attractor is a potential state of high utility for one or more telors."}
{{"telonic", "adjective"} -> "Behaving like a telon or having properties of a telon."}
